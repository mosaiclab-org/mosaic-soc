# Block A, the GF180MCU reference design, from one prompt.
#
# WHAT THIS DEMONSTRATES
# ----------------------
# Natural-language intent can author CONFIGURATION while deterministic Python
# does the generating and the checking. The design used here is Block A, whose
# frozen configuration is configs/mosaic_tapeout_ultra.yaml.
#
# Be precise about which part is which:
#
#   Steps 2-5 call NO MODEL. The parse is an ordered regex grammar, so they run
#   in CI and cannot pass by luck -- but for the same reason they are evidence
#   about the GUARDRAILS, not about an LLM. Step 3's field-for-field match is a
#   regression pin (the grammar and the frozen config must not drift apart);
#   steps 4 and 5 are the capability gate refusing false `tapeout` claims, which
#   is the part that makes a model safe to point at this repo.
#
#   Step 6 is the only step where a MODEL does the work. It is gated on Claude
#   Code (`claude`) being on PATH, not on an API key. The model gets the same
#   framing `mosaic agent` sends (imported from the harness, not retyped here)
#   and must reach the frozen config through typed CLI arguments, with the
#   grammar explicitly off the table.
#
# Step 6 is REPORTED, not asserted: a model run is evidence, and the exit status
# stays governed by the deterministic steps so this file cannot go flaky. A
# divergence is printed in full rather than swallowed.
#
# Usage:  ./demo/03_blocka_from_prompt.sh
#         MOSAIC_DEMO_AGENT=off ./demo/03_blocka_from_prompt.sh   # skip step 6
