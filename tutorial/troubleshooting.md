# Troubleshooting the tutorial

Always run tutorial commands from the repository root. When a stage fails,
fix that stage and rerun it; do not skip ahead to a later PASS marker.

## Quick failure table

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `ModuleNotFoundError`, missing `fusesoc`, or no `.venv` | Python environment not created or activated | Run `make venv`, then `source .venv/bin/activate`, and retry from the repo root. |
| `ERROR: no RISC-V toolchain` | `RISCV_TC` is unset and no `riscv32-*-elf-gcc` is on `PATH` | Run inside `nix develop .#sim`, or export `RISCV_TC=/path/to/bin/riscv32-unknown-elf` and verify with `"${RISCV_TC}-gcc" --version`. |
| `ERROR: Verilator 5.050 required; PATH has: ...` | The `verilator` on `PATH` is missing or is another version | Run inside `nix develop .#sim`, or export `VERILATOR_PIN` to the install prefix of a 5.050 build. |
| `ERROR: VERILATOR_PIN=... has no bin/verilator or usr/bin/verilator` | `VERILATOR_PIN` does not point at an install prefix | Point it at the directory that contains `bin/verilator` or `usr/bin/verilator`. |
| `[FAIL] ... has <N> validation error(s)` | YAML violates the authoritative schema | Read every reported error; fix the YAML, then rerun `config-author validate`. |
| Topology check reports findings | Unsupported fabric, bank count, or semantic combination | Correct the config before RTL generation. Do not treat the diagram as approval. |
| `RTL gen failed` | Invalid config or template/generator error | Check the immediately preceding error and rerun validation first. |
| `FuseSoC setup failed` | Dependency generator or toolchain issue | Read `tb/mosaic_soc/fusesoc-setup-generic.log` or the path printed by `make mosaic-gen`. |
| `BUILD FAILED` | Verilator compile/elaboration error | Read `tb/mosaic_soc/build-generic.log`; search from the first `%Error`. |
| Simulation exits without `EXIT SUCCESS` | One or more harts did not reach the exact sentinel | Read `tb/mosaic_soc/sim-generic.log`; the flow is a failure even if the process exit code is zero. |
| `OPENCODE_API_KEY is not set` | Key was not exported in this shell | Use the hidden zsh `read -rs` sequence in `03-opencode-go.md`. |
| API setup succeeds but the request fails | Missing/expired key, subscription, quota, or model access | Check `./mosaic setup show`, then verify the account in OpenCode Go. Never paste the key into logs. |
| `raw model ID` error | TUI-prefixed model name used | Use `kimi-k2.7-code`, not `opencode-go/kimi-k2.7-code`. |

## The build hash changed

This is normal. MOSAIC builds are content-addressed, so a config or source
change produces a new directory such as:

```text
build/mosaic/tutorial_soc-<new-hash>/
```

Locate the active manifest instead of hard-coding the hash:

```bash
./.venv/bin/python util/mosaic_gen/build_manifest.py locate \
  --config tutorial/configs/tutorial_soc.yaml \
  --base-config configs/general.hjson \
  --pads-cfg configs/pad_cfg.py \
  --repo-root "$PWD" \
  --output-root build/mosaic
```

## Expected warnings versus failures

FuseSoC may print warnings about legacy or unknown metadata in vendored cores.
Use the hard end markers:

```text
FuseSoC setup completed successfully.
### MOSAIC manifest: .../manifest.json
```

For simulation, only this is completion evidence:

```text
### RESULT: EXIT SUCCESS — all <N> configured harts executed ✓
```

## Useful log and artifact locations

```text
build/mosaic/<soc>-<hash>/manifest.json
build/mosaic/<soc>-<hash>/generated/
build/agent/sessions/
tb/mosaic_soc/fusesoc-setup-generic.log
tb/mosaic_soc/build-generic.log
tb/mosaic_soc/sim-generic.log
```

## Reset the tutorial's generated outputs

Everything created under `build/tutorial/` and `build/mosaic/` is generated and
ignored by Git. You may remove the relevant tutorial build directories and
rerun the stages. Do not delete or edit files under `hw/vendor/`.

If you ran the optional deterministic one-command example, it deliberately
created `configs/tutorial_agent.yaml`; remove that file only if you do not want
to keep the generated example config.

## Still stuck?

Capture these items without secrets:

```bash
git status --short
./mosaic doctor
verilator --version
"${RISCV_TC}-gcc" --version
./mosaic config-author validate tutorial/configs/tutorial_soc.yaml
```

`./mosaic doctor` lists each tool it found, its version, and whether that
version matches the one the project pins.

Then include the first actual error from the relevant log, not only its final
summary line. Never include `OPENCODE_API_KEY` or a plaintext provider config.
