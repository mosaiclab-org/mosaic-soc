# MOSAIC-SoC hands-on tutorial

This tutorial takes one small heterogeneous SoC from YAML to generated RTL and
then proves that every configured hart executes. It also shows the same flow
through `mosaic`, first without an LLM and then with the optional OpenCode Go
API driver.

The tutorial SoC is deliberately small:

```text
hart 0: cv32e20  TITAN  ─┐
hart 1: FazyRV   ATLAS  ─┼─ OBI fabric ─ 32 KiB SRAM + TDU + peripherals
hart 2: SERV     NANO   ─┘
```

All commands are run from the repository root. Expected-output blocks show the
stable success markers; hashes, absolute paths, cycle counts, and elapsed times
are written as `<hash>`, `<cycles>`, or `<seconds>` because they vary by machine.

Before starting any path, enter the pinned simulation shell, then create and
activate the Python environment:

```bash
nix develop .#sim
make venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

`nix develop .#sim` is the simulation shell defined in `flake.nix`. It provides
Verilator 5.050 and a bare-metal RISC-V GCC, and it exports `RISCV_TC`, the
compiler prefix the simulation runners read. The runners accept Verilator
5.050 and no other version. Without Nix, set `VERILATOR_PIN` and `RISCV_TC`
yourself as described in
[Chapter 1, Stage 0](01-generator.md#stage-0--prepare-the-tools).

## Choose a path

| Goal | Start here |
|---|---|
| Understand the generator directly | [01-generator.md](01-generator.md) |
| Use the deterministic harness | [02-harness.md](02-harness.md) |
| Configure the OpenCode Go API agent | [03-opencode-go.md](03-opencode-go.md) |
| Diagnose a failure | [troubleshooting.md](troubleshooting.md) |

For the shortest verified path, run the whole tutorial as one script. From
outside the Nix shell:

```bash
nix develop .#sim --command bash tutorial/run_all.sh
```

From inside it, `./tutorial/run_all.sh` does the same. The script creates
`.venv` itself if it is missing.

Expected final lines:

```text
### RESULT: EXIT SUCCESS — all 3 configured harts executed ✓
### Tutorial complete
### Topology: build/tutorial/tutorial_soc_topology.html
```

The script checks the tools, then performs schema validation, semantic topology
checks, topology rendering, direct RTL generation, manifest inspection, and the
topology-generic full-SoC simulation. It stops at the first failed stage.

## What success means

The final `EXIT SUCCESS` proves that the generated full-SoC model booted the
TITAN, dispatched the two dormant workers through the TDU, and observed the
exact per-hart liveness sentinels. It is stronger than template rendering or a
zero simulator return code alone.

It does **not** claim physical signoff. Synthesis, place-and-route, STA, DRC, and
LVS remain separate hard gates; see [`flow/librelane/README.md`](../flow/librelane/README.md)
after completing this tutorial.
