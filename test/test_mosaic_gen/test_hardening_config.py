"""Emitting a hardening config instead of hand-writing one.

The acceptance test for the config generator is the first one here: regenerating Block A's
hardening config from its SoC config must reproduce the file that was actually
hardened, key for key. Block A is a real signed-off design -- 0 DRC, LVS clean,
GDS -- so if the generator agrees with it, the generator produces configs that
are known to work rather than configs that merely parse.
