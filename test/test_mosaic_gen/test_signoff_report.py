"""Reading a run's signoff numbers once, instead of by hand every time.

Every experiment in this project ended with the same manual step: open two
metrics.json files, pull the same dozen keys, convert um2 to mm2 by hand and
write the comparison into prose. A confounded experiment survived a whole run
because the die had moved and nothing printed the die.

    boot failure turned out to be a zero-delay simulation race: that netlist

    buffering, which cannot change behaviour in zero delay.
