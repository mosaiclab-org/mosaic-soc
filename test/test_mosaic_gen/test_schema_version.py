"""`soc.schema`: a config states which rules accepted it.

`allowed_soc` is a single evolving frozenset, so before this key a config could
not record the schema it was authored against. Two consequences, both silent:
a config written months ago and one written today are indistinguishable, and a
config rots as the validator changes underneath it -- keys appear, meanings
tighten, and nothing says which version actually accepted the file.

The discipline is OpenADA's, whose operation profiles are immutable and
versioned by identifier: changing a required field, a value's meaning, or a
closed shape requires a NEW identifier while the old one keeps working.

What this file pins:

- omitting the key still works, so every existing config is valid unchanged;
- an unknown version is refused BY NAME, not as a wall of unknown-key errors
  from a validator that was never meant to read that file;
- the frozen tapeout config declares its schema, so the freeze artifact is
  self-describing;
- generated configs declare it too, so new files do not inherit the old
  ambiguity.
