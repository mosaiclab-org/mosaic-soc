"""The one escape hatch in the signoff runner must not be able to skip a check.

run_signoff.sh exists because every other experimental run passed a list of
--skips to shorten the loop, which is how "0 routing DRC" got mistaken for "DRC
clean". Its guarantee is negative: there is no way to turn a check off.

MOSAIC_RESOURCE_CONFIG puts a crack in that. It appends keys to the resolved
config so a memory-constrained host can cap thread counts -- KLayout DRC on
mosaic_block_c was SIGKILLed twice by the OOM killer at the deck's default
thread count. The previous fix was to hand-append a key to .resolved_<tag>.yaml,
which works and makes the run unreproducible, since that file is regenerated.

The hatch is safe only because of one restriction: it accepts nothing but
*_THREADS keys. A thread count changes how long a check takes, never whether it
passes. These tests hold that restriction in place by running the runner's OWN
patterns -- extracted from the script, not copied here -- over inputs that a
future edit might let through.
