"""FazyRV memory-timing contract.

`fazyrv_sci` presents the core with exactly ONE memory model: a combinational
(0-latency) Wishbone Classic slave, synthesised by freezing the core's clock
until the transfer it issued returns. There is no second contract to select
between, so MEMDLY1 must be 0.

MEMDLY1=1 builds a core that asserts stb/cyc for exactly one cycle and ignores
the ack for flow control::

    fazyrv_cntrl.sv:  if (MEMDLY1 | imem_ack_i) state_n = DECODE;

Against a slower slave the IR load pulse (`stb_ir_i = ack`) then lands
mid-execution and overwrites the decoded instruction registers, silently
corrupting results. Measured: a `lui a1,0x20040` produced 0x80100000 in the
address register, and MEMDLY1=1 broke a FazyRV worker that passes without it.
