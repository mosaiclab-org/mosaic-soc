"""The typed CLI surface an agent drives, and the framing it is driven with.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
--------------------
`demo/03_blocka_from_prompt.sh` step 6 hands a real model the Block A request
and requires it to reach the frozen tapeout config through `config-author
generate` flags -- with `soc-from-prompt` (the deterministic grammar)
explicitly off the table.

That demo is only meaningful if two things hold, and neither is obvious:

  1. The typed CLI can EXPRESS the tapeout design at all. Until this surface
     existed it could not: there were no flags for the eight platform knobs or
     for per-core with_csr/compressed/boot_addr, so the only route to Block A
     was `--preset blocka` -- i.e. typing a preset name, which demonstrates
     nothing about translation. A regression here would quietly turn step 6
     back into that.
  2. The demo drives the model with the SAME framing `mosaic agent` sends.
     A demo that invented its own prompt would be evidence about the demo.
