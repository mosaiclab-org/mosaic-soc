    it sets PnR corners, repair margins and PDN geometry, and its only readers
    are harness/physical/hardening.py and harness/skills/flow_runner.py.

    Counting it meant that changing one repair margin -- which is exactly what
    a flow experiment does -- moved the bundle hash and made the next run abort
    with "no MOSAIC manifest", demanding a multi-hour regen that reproduces
    byte-identical RTL. Measured: blocka_reharden and blocka_slewonly have

    the wasted hours, it is the pressure to reuse a stale bundle instead.
