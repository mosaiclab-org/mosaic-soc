"""The external drivers are gated, or they do not launch.

The defect these close: `--driver claude` was a `subprocess.call` with a
prompt. Scope ceiling, evidence binding and completion gate all existed in
`AgentRunner` and applied to nothing the external driver did.

The load-bearing test is `test_the_wp1_acceptance_scenario`, which is the
acceptance scenario for the gated MCP server: a session whose
ceiling was derived as `simulation`, an external MCP client calling
`flow_run{flow: "harden-classic"}`, and the *same* refusal the built-in loop
produces in-process.
