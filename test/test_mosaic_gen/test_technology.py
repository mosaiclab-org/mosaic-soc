The goal is any SoC on ANY PDK. Before this, five of `pdk-port`'s eight
requirements were satisfied for GF180 only by being hardcoded, and a second

back, labelled as though they had been measured.

These tests pin the two properties that matter: GF180 answers do not move, and
a technology nobody has declared is REFUSED rather than served another
