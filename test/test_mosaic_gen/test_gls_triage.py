"""A triage skill must report what its oracle can see before what it found.

Shaped by a real incident. A GLS failure here was tracked across four netlists
and localised to a missing `dlya_2` cell. It was a cell SWAP: instance _28773_
was dlya_2 in every booting netlist and clkbuf_1 in the failing one, same nets,
both non-inverting buffers, a no-op in zero delay. The real cause was a race
between zero-delay evaluation and UDP flops.

A skill that named a cell there would have been confidently wrong, so these
tests are mostly about what it REFUSES to conclude.
