"""Every flow declares effect, cost, required scope and approval, with no default.

The defect this closes was an asymmetry inside one function. `gates.py` was
fail-closed for tools:

    elif allowed is None:
        return "... has no request-scope policy" / "fail-closed tool authorization"

and fail-OPEN for flows, deciding authorization by reading the name:

    elif flow.startswith("tb-") or flow in {"verilator-run", "pytest"}:
        ...
    else:
        flow_scopes = {"rtl", "simulation", "integration", "physical"}

So a flow whose authorization nobody chose inherited one from its prefix, and
adding a flow without deciding who may run it succeeded silently.
