"""Deriving a die size instead of fitting one.

Hardening Block A and Block B measured that the floorplan is the only design-dependent part of a
hardening config: Block B changed three knobs against Block A, two of them the
same knob, while PDN, timing and check configuration carried over untouched and
produced a clean result on a design they were never tuned for.

The load-bearing claim of this module is therefore narrow and checkable: given
a design, the die size is *derivable*. These tests hold it to the three designs
that have actually been hardened, and hold the model to refusing anything it
has no evidence for.
