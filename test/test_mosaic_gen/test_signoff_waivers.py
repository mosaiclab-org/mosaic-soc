"""Waivers: bounded, design-scoped, dated, and never silent.

A waiver mechanism is the feature most able to quietly destroy an evidence
gate, so these tests are written against the ways it could go wrong rather
than the way it is meant to be used.

The properties pinned here:

- a waiver is a CEILING, so a regression past the waived count still fails;
- a waiver is scoped to ONE design, so Block A's waivers cannot travel to the
  next design we harden -- which is literally the next thing on the roadmap;
- a waiver EXPIRES, so it cannot outlive the person who granted it;
- a waiver cannot suppress DRC, LVS, timing or antenna verdicts, only findings
  from the generic adverse sweep;
- a malformed waiver file RAISES rather than degrading to "no waivers";
- a waived run is a PASS that says so.
