"""The PPA objective: what an automatic improvement loop may optimise.

Every physical decision so far ended with a person reading two tables. These
tests pin the three things that had to become code before a loop could do it:
which runs count at all (gates), when one is better than another
(comparison) -- including when the question is refused -- and which setting,
if any, the difference can be blamed on (the ledger).
