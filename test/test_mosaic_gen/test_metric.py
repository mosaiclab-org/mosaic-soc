"""A number with a unit, a corner, a PDK and a source.

Two evidence rules are enforced at construction here rather than audited
later:

  * "every numeric metric has a unit and source artifact"
  * "timing/power evidence without corner/voltage is rejected"

The third thing this guards is not one of those rules but is in the project's
goal: GF180 is
the first PDK, not the only one. A metric recorded without its PDK will be
compared against a different process eventually.
