# ── schema versioning ────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# `allowed_soc` below is a single evolving frozenset, so until now a config
# could not state which schema it was written against. A config authored months
# ago and one authored today are indistinguishable, and a config rots silently
# as the set changes underneath it: keys are added, meanings tighten, and
# nothing records which rules it was actually accepted under.
#
# `soc.schema` fixes that with one key. The discipline is OpenADA's, whose
# operation profiles are immutable and versioned by filename -- changing a
# required field, a value's meaning, or a closed shape requires a NEW
# identifier, and the old one keeps working. Concretely, when v2 lands:
#
#   * `mosaic/v1` stays in this table pointing at a FROZEN copy of today's
#     rules, so a v1 config keeps validating exactly as it does now;
#   * `mosaic/v2` gets its own entry;
#   * a config that says neither is refused by name.
#
# Omitting the key means `mosaic/v1`, so every config in the repo today is
# already valid and nothing needs a migration.

# ── objectives ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# The schema is otherwise purely STRUCTURAL: it says what is in the SoC and
# nothing about what the SoC must achieve. That gap is why a hardening config
# cannot be generated -- there is no field a clock period could be derived
# from, so Block A's `CLOCK_PERIOD: 100` was a human decision recorded in a
# comment.
#
# `objectives` is the smallest addition that closes it. Deliberately not a
# performance model: `target_clock_mhz` is a REQUEST that the physical flow
# either meets or does not, and STA remains the only thing that decides which.
# Budgets are optional and, when present, are checked against measured results
# rather than used to prune anything.
# `die_um` is a MANDATE (a fixed die the block must match exactly); the max_*
# keys are BOUNDS the derived die must fit inside. Different meanings, so
# different keys -- a mandated die is not "at most this big", it is this big.
# `repair_margin_pct` is a per-design override of the signoff template's
# GRT_DESIGN_REPAIR_MAX_SLEW_PCT. It sits with the die and the clock because
# it is a statement about THIS design: Block A cannot reach zero max-slew at
# the shipped 45 on its mandated 1110 um die, while B and C can.
# `target_utilisation` is the density the die is sized at, and it belongs with
# the die because it is what makes a die achievable: Block A's mandated 1110 um
