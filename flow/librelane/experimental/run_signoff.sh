# End-to-end signoff run for the Block A macro.
#
# The point of this script is what it does NOT contain: there is no --skip.
# Every other run in experimental/ passes a long list of them to shorten the
# loop, which is how "0 routing DRC" got mistaken for "DRC clean". Here Magic
# DRC, KLayout DRC, Magic SPICE extraction, Netgen LVS, KLayout XOR, the
# antenna checks and the IR-drop/power-grid analysis all run, and any of them
# can fail the flow.
#
# Runtime is hours. Expect DRC and LVS to find things on the first attempt --
# that is the purpose.
#
# Usage:  ./run_signoff.sh [run-tag] [config]
#         MOSAIC_CFG=configs/<design>.yaml ./run_signoff.sh <tag> <config>
#
# The config defaults to Block A. MOSAIC_CFG selects which generated RTL bundle
# is hardened and already had to be set separately, so the two must agree: the
# hardening config names the top module, MOSAIC_CFG decides what is inside it.
