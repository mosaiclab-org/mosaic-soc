// Gate-level testbench for the Block A macro.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS
// ---------------
// Every simulation up to now ran on RTL. This one runs on the POST-PLACE-AND-
// ROUTE netlist -- the actual gates in the GDS, with the PDK's own cell models
// -- and optionally with SDF timing back-annotated. It closes the last open
// item of the physical phase ("post-synthesis gate-level
// simulation once a netlist exists").
//
// It also verifies something no RTL testbench can: that synthesis, CTS, place
// and route preserved the design's behaviour. Bugs 28 and 31 were both cases of
// RTL that elaborated and simulated happily while being wrong; this is the
// complementary check, RTL-correct-but-implementation-broken.
//
// THE INTERFACE IS THE CHIP'S
// ---------------------------
// This drives only the 22 pins that are bonded out. There is no
// backdoor memory load, no hierarchical force, no probing of internal state --
// the design boots XIP from a behavioural QSPI flash and reports through
// status_valid_o/status_o, which with soc.debug: false is the only observability
// the silicon has. If this passes, the part can be brought up on a board the
// same way.
//
// Usage (see run_gls.sh):
//   +firmware=<hex>   flash image, Verilog hex from objcopy -O verilog
//   +sdf=<file>       optional SDF for timing-annotated GLS
//   +maxcycles=<n>    watchdog
