"""A session-scoped MCP stdio server over the typed harness registry.

WHAT THIS FIXES
---------------
`mosaic agent --driver claude` used to be a `subprocess.call`: the external
agent received a prompt and then acted with no scope ceiling, no evidence
binding and no completion gate. Every one of those rules existed in
`AgentRunner` and applied to nothing the external drivers did. A prompt asking
for a simulation could end with a physical-design flow, and nothing in the
harness would have objected.

This server puts the same gates in front of an external client. It speaks MCP
over stdio, so Claude Code, Codex, opencode and oh-my-pi all reach it from one
artifact, and it holds one `AgentState` per request: evidence recorded by one
call is what a later call is gated against.

TWO WAYS TO SET THE CEILING
---------------------------
LOCKED. `--request` (or MOSAIC_REQUEST) is the user's actual request. The
ceiling is derived from it with the same `classify_request_scope` the built-in
loop uses and locked before the client connects. `mosaic agent --driver
claude|omp` launches it this way.

PLUGIN. A host that loads us as a plugin starts the server before anyone has
typed anything, so there is no request to derive from. The ceiling is then a
standing allowlist the user writes into the host config (MOSAIC_SCOPES,
default: everything except integration and physical). The model binds each
request with `session_new` and picks a scope inside the allowlist. Because the
request text is model-supplied in this mode, the classifier is only a hint.

In both modes, selecting `physical` or `integration`, running an
approval-declared flow, and applying a wrapper need a person's approval token
(`mosaic approve <scope>`, TTY only). See harness/approvals.py.

WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO
--------------------------------
No shell, no file editor, no "allow all tools" escape. The registry executes
registered harness operations only. Upstream projects reviewed for this work
ship `--dangerously-skip-permissions`, `--yolo` and `danger-full-access`; this
server must not weaken our position for convenience, and it does not.

PROTOCOL
--------
JSON-RPC 2.0, one message per line, on stdin/stdout — hand-rolled rather than
taking an `mcp` dependency for a handful of methods. stdout carries protocol
ONLY; anything human-readable goes to stderr, because a stray print corrupts
the stream.
