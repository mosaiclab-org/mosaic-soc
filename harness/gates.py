"""The authorization gates, shared by every driver that can act.

WHY THIS IS ITS OWN MODULE
--------------------------
These checks used to be methods on `AgentRunner`, which meant they applied to
the built-in loop and to nothing else. The `claude` and `omp` drivers were a
`subprocess.call` handoff: the model got a prompt and ran with no scope
ceiling, no evidence binding and no completion gate. The policy existed and
simply was not on that path.

An MCP server has to enforce exactly the same rules, and "exactly the same"
cannot survive two copies. So the gates live here as free functions over
`(state, registry, scope_required)`, and `AgentRunner` and the MCP session both
call them. Neither owns them.

WHAT THEY ENFORCE
-----------------
1. **The ceiling is derived from the user's request, not chosen by the model.**
   `request_scope` is locked once authorized; a model that asks to widen it is
   refused.
2. **Evidence binding.** `mosaic-gen-config` needs a current `topology_check`;
   the tb-* flows need a current generation. "Current" means the digest still
   matches, so a stale pass does not count.
3. **Fail-closed.** A tool with no entry in the scope table is refused rather
   than allowed -- adding a tool without deciding its authorization is a
   mistake that should stop the session, not widen it.
