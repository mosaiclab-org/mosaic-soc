"""What each skill is allowed to do, in the same terms as a flow.

Twenty-one flows declared effect, cost, scopes and approval; the ten skills
that ORCHESTRATE those flows declared nothing. So the boundary was stated for
the thing being run and not for the thing doing the running, and a new skill
inherited no policy at all.

These declarations go through `build_specs`, the same function the flow table
uses, so skills are held to the same rule and the same import-time refusals:
an undeclared field, an unknown scope, or an approval column that disagrees
with `requires_approval` fails at import rather than at run time.

HOW THESE WERE DERIVED
----------------------
Each entry comes from reading the skill module, its CLI wiring in
`harness/__main__.py`, its agent surface in `harness/agent_tools.py`, and its
card under `.claude/skills/`. Three were then adversarially re-checked by an
independent pass that tried to refute them (config_author, doc_gen,
drc_triage); all three survived. The remaining seven carry the classification
without that second pass, and the honest status is recorded per entry.

The claim that matters most -- that NO skill writes evidence -- does not rest
on either pass. It is checkable in one line and was checked separately:
`signoff_waivers` is named in two skill modules: `flow_runner`, at two
`"waivers":` keys that feed `load_waivers`, and `waiver_author`, which loads
the waiver file to audit it. `signoff_template` is named in none. All are
read-side. Nothing here can author a waiver today,
which is why every entry declares evidence False and why the rule's second
clause currently binds nothing.

The `waiver-author` skill that now exists does not change that: it audits a
waiver against the run it cites and writes nothing. It will change with the
first skill that writes a waiver, and the point of declaring the field now is
that such a skill cannot be added without answering the question.

COST IS WHAT IT INVOKES, NOT WHAT IT RETURNS
--------------------------------------------
`flow_runner` and `tb_matrix` return in seconds and are declared HOURS, because
what they launch is a LibreLane hardening run and a full covering-array sweep.
Declaring the Python's own runtime would have put the two skills that can spend
an afternoon of compute on the no-approval side of the rule.
