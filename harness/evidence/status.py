"""Evidence and execution status vocabularies.

Two orthogonal enums, deliberately kept disjoint.

``ExecutionStatus`` answers *"could we invoke and observe the process?"* and
follows ``openada.result/v0alpha1`` (simra-tech/OpenADA, MIT).

``EvidenceStatus`` answers *"what does the evidence support?"* and uses
this project's own vocabulary, which is a strict superset of OpenADA's four engineering states:
it adds ``UNSUPPORTED`` (a deterministic capability proof that the requested
operation cannot be implemented) and ``INFRASTRUCTURE_ERROR`` (the stage ran
but did not produce a parseable mandatory report).

The rules encoded here:

- ``UNKNOWN``: the node has not run, or an upstream prerequisite has no
  evidence.
- ``UNSUPPORTED``: deterministic capability analysis proves the requested
  operation cannot be implemented by the selected backend/tool/PDK.
- ``INFRASTRUCTURE_ERROR``: an executed stage did not produce a mandatory
  report, or the report could not be parsed or validated.
- ``FAIL``: the stage executed validly but a threshold was violated.
- ``NOT_APPLICABLE``: deterministic graph construction proves the node is
  irrelevant. *The model cannot assign it.*
- ``PASS``: the node executed, all mandatory reports are valid, and every
  required threshold passed.

A zero exit code never implies ``PASS``; a nonzero exit code never implies
``FAIL``. An incomplete execution normally leaves evidence ``UNKNOWN``.
