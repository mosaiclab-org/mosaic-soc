"""Turn an OpenSTA `report_power` into typed metrics that carry their corner.

The evidence rules are "every numeric metric has a unit and source artifact" and "power
evidence without a corner is rejected". `Metric` already refuses both, so this
module's job is narrow: read the report faithfully and hand `Metric` what it
needs, never inventing the parts it would otherwise refuse over.

That has one consequence worth stating up front. The corner is parsed from the
report's own banner, not passed in by a caller who thinks they know which
directory they read. A report whose banner is missing produces no metrics and
an explicit complaint, because a caller supplying the corner from a path is
exactly how a `max_ss` number ends up labelled `nom_tt`.

WHAT THE NUMBERS MEAN. `report_power` without switching activity applies a
default toggle model, and on this design that produces ~99% clock and
sequential power: a clock-tree cost, not workload power. This module does not
decide which one it read. It reports what the file said and defers to
`workload.power_metric_status`, which is the module that can tell.
