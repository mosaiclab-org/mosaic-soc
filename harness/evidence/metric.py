"""Typed metrics: a number with a unit, a corner, a PDK and where it came from.

Two rules: "every numeric metric has a unit and source artifact", and
"timing/power evidence without corner/voltage is rejected". Both are enforced here at construction rather than checked later,
because a metric that reached a report without provenance has already done the
damage.

WHAT WAS WRONG WITH BARE FLOATS
-------------------------------
`SignoffEvidence` carries `wns_ns: Optional[float]` -- the unit lives in the
FIELD NAME, so it cannot survive being put in a dict, compared, or summed.
`area: Dict[str, float]` does not even manage that. Across this project's
sessions the same numbers have been hand-converted between um2 and mm2, ns and
ps, repeatedly, in prose. Every one of those conversions was an opportunity to
be wrong and none of them was checked.

THE PDK DIMENSION IS NOT OPTIONAL
---------------------------------
GF180 is the first target PDK, not the only one: IHP, SkyWater, FreePDK and
ASAP are planned. Almost everything physical this project has measured is
PDK-specific -- the 0.56 x 3.92 um site, the 4.0 ns max transition, the
0.419 mm2/KB SRAM, the whole per-hart area calibration. A metric recorded
without its PDK is a number that will silently be compared against a different
process later, so `pdk` is a field here from the start rather than a retrofit.
The evidence store also requires that changing PDK views invalidates dependent
evidence, which
is impossible if the evidence never recorded which views it used.

WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO
----------------------------------
It does not guess. LibreLane emits 336 metrics per run and this classifies the
ones whose naming convention is unambiguous; the rest get `UNKNOWN` and say so.
An inferred unit that is wrong is worse than an absent one, because it will be
converted.
