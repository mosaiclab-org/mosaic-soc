"""A content-addressed evidence store, keyed on everything that produced it.

The requirement: "immutable content-addressed evidence store", plus the two
invalidation criteria -- "changing config, RTL, firmware, workload, SDC/UPF,
PDK views, or tool image invalidates the correct descendants" and "changing a
parser or FlowSpec invalidates dependent evidence".

THE IDEA, WHICH IS SMALLER THAN IT SOUNDS
-----------------------------------------
Invalidation is not a mechanism here. The key IS the digest of the inputs, so
asking "is my evidence still valid?" is asking "does a record exist under the
key today's inputs produce?" -- and if any input moved, it does not. There is
no cache to sweep and no dependency graph to walk, which is the point: a graph
that has to be maintained is a graph that drifts.

WHAT COUNTS AS AN INPUT
-----------------------
Six things, each read from a real artefact rather than asserted:

  rtl_bundle    the content-addressed FuseSoC bundle the RTL came from,
                recovered from the run's own VERILOG_FILES paths
  config_digest the hardening config, MINUS the resolved file list -- those
                are absolute paths that differ per machine and are already
                covered by rtl_bundle. Including them would make evidence
                un-shareable between two checkouts of the same commit.
  pdk           `gf180mcuD` today. GF180 is the first target, not the only
                one; IHP, SkyWater, FreePDK and ASAP are planned, and a
                measurement carries no meaning without the process it was
                taken on.
  std_cell      the library within that PDK, which changes cell areas and
                every timing number
  tool          librelane version, the runtime (nix or iic:<tag>), and the
                lock narHash of librelane, nix-eda and nixpkgs -- the version
                string alone does not identify a build
  parser        a digest of the modules that READ the run. The second
                invalidation rule asks for this explicitly, and it is the
                one input nobody thinks of: fixing a parser bug changes what
                the numbers mean while every other input stays put.
  pdk_views     a digest of the PDK view FILES this run actually consumed --
                liberty per corner, tech and cell LEFs, pad LEFs, the Verilog
                cell models, the RCX rulesets, and the GDS/mag layout views.

HASHING THE VIEWS, WHICH USED TO BE THE STATED GAP
--------------------------------------------------
This module used to record only the PDK *name*, on the grounds that GF180's
clone is 1.2 GB. That caught a PDK swap and not an in-place edit of a PDK
file, and it said so.

The 1.2 GB figure was the wrong measurement. A run does not consume the clone;
it consumes the files `resolved.json` names, and those are **496 files and
86 MB** -- about three seconds, on a lookup that guards a multi-hour hardening
run and happens twice in the CLI. So the views are hashed now.

Two properties worth stating, because both are easy to get wrong:

  * The digest is over `(basename, sha256)` pairs, sorted -- NOT over absolute
    paths. `resolved.json` records paths under whichever checkout produced it,
    so hashing those would make two clones of the same commit disagree about
    identical PDKs, which is the same mistake `config_digest` already avoids.
  * A view named by the config and missing from disk hashes as `MISSING`
    rather than being skipped. Skipping it would let deleting a liberty file
    reproduce the key of a run that had it.
