"""Fail-closed gate execution.

A gate that cannot run is not a pass. This module exists because the opposite
default is easy to write by accident: wrap a gate in ``try/except``, return
``True`` on error, and every broken parser, missing tool, or typo in the gate
itself silently ships as a PASS.

The mechanism is adapted from CoreSmith's ``orchestrator/langgraph/gate_guard.py``
(facebookexperimental/coresmith, MIT), whose docstring names the bug it fixed:
call sites that returned ``passed=True`` on any error, *"a fail-OPEN default
that silently shipped a block whose gate could not run."* The status vocabulary
is ours (``harness/evidence/status.py``), so a raised gate here becomes
``INFRASTRUCTURE_ERROR`` rather than a bare ``False``.

Contract:

- ``fn`` returns normally -> ``PASS``, or ``classify(value)`` decides.
- ``fn`` raises -> ``INFRASTRUCTURE_ERROR`` with a traceback tail. An error is
  **not** an honest skip and **not** a fail: the threshold was never
  evaluated.
- ``MOSAIC_GATE_FAIL_OPEN=1`` is the single documented rollback knob. Under it
  a raised gate is tolerated as ``UNKNOWN`` with ``skipped=True`` — still not
  a ``PASS``, because no evidence was produced either way.

Fail-closed is the default everywhere. This is a correctness property, not a
policy choice, so nothing seeds the rollback variable.
