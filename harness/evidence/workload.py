"""What a workload run establishes, and what it does not establish about power.

The rules:
  * "workload runner and region-of-interest activity capture"
  * "workload evidence without firmware/workload hashes is rejected"
  * "failed workload oracles, incomplete ROIs, and insufficient activity
     coverage cannot produce valid power evidence"

THE FINDING THAT CAME FIRST
---------------------------
Every signoff run in this project reports power. `blocka_reharden` says
`power__total` 0.0586 W and that number is already in the evidence store. It
is not workload power. LibreLane's STA script runs

    report_power -corner $corner_name

with no activity input at all -- no `read_vcd`, no `read_saif`, no
`set_power_activity` -- so OpenSTA falls back to its default toggle model. The
report shows the signature plainly: combinational switching is 0.5% of total
while clock and sequential are 99.5%, which is what you get when nothing told
the tool what the design was doing.

That is a legitimate number for "what does the clock tree cost", and it is not
what anyone means by power. So the first job here is not to build a better
estimate; it is to stop the existing one being mistaken for one. `Metric`
already refuses timing without a corner. Power without activity is the same
class of missing provenance, and this module names it.

WHAT A RUN CAN AND CANNOT ANCHOR TO TODAY
-----------------------------------------
Corrected 2026-09-21 against the logs on disk, because this paragraph described
a bench that does not exist. NO testbench prints a bare `cycles=` count: the
gate-level bench prints `after N cycles` on completion and `(roi_cycles=M)` when
its activity window closes, and the full-SoC benches print no cycle count at
all. `tb/mosaic_soc/sim.log` and `sim-generic.log` contain `EXIT SUCCESS` and
nothing else countable. So the ROI came back None from every real artefact and
every workload was refused for "no region of interest" -- a refusal that was
right in outcome and wrong in reason.

The route out named below is also out of date. The gate-level bench DOES dump a
VCD, gated on `GLS_VCD`: `$dumpvars(0, dut)` over the whole DUT hierarchy for a
window set by `GLS_VCD_START`/`GLS_VCD_CYCLES` (tb/gls/gls_tb.sv:104-120). What
is missing is not a route but a run -- no capture has been taken, so no
`ActivityCapture` has ever been constructed.

The bound is now in the log too: `run_gls.sh` records its plusargs, so
`+maxcycles=` is readable and a truncated run can be told from a finished one.
