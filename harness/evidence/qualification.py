"""The qualification rules, as a record that refuses to exist without them.

Three rules:

  1. every numeric metric has a unit and a source artefact;
  2. timing and power evidence without a corner is rejected;
  3. workload evidence without firmware and workload hashes is rejected.

`Metric` enforces 1 and 2 at construction and `WorkloadRun` enforces 3, so this
module does not re-implement them. It does the part neither can: it holds a
whole result together and refuses to call it qualified when the pieces do not
support the claim, which is where the interesting failures live.

WHY THIS EXISTS RATHER THAN A DICT. A qualification result travels: it gets
summarised into a dashboard, quoted in a reply, and pasted into a
form. Every one of those is a place where a number loses its corner on the
way. The measured example is in this repository. LibreLane promotes ONE corner
to the unsuffixed `power__total` key, and it is `max_ff_n40C_5v50` (5.50 V,
-40 C), the highest-power corner. Reading that key and calling it "power at 5 V"
mixes a 5.50 V measurement with a 5.00 V supply and produces a current that was
never measured at any corner. `unsuffixed_corner` below names the corner instead
of letting a reader assume a nominal one.
