"""Decide whether detailed routing is going to converge, while it still can.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
Block C at a 75% utilisation target ran detailed routing for eleven hours and
never converged. It plateaued near 3500 violations from iteration 4 to 16, a
rip-up then RAISED it 2906 -> 8552, and it was still at 1049 when the session
that launched it died -- without ever reaching its 64-iteration budget. The
same design at 65% routed to zero by iteration 10 and finished the whole flow
in 2 h 19 m.

Nothing available before the run predicted that. Two things were tried:

  * Utilisation compared across designs. Block C failed at 80.9% achieved while
    Block B routed clean at 82.2%. A bigger die means longer average nets, so
    the same density is harder to route in a bigger design; the comparison is
    only valid within one design.
  * Global-route overflow. GRT reported ZERO overflow on every layer for the
    run that then failed for eleven hours. It works on a coarse gcell grid with
    -allow_congestion and is not a routability signal.

What does discriminate is the SHAPE OF THE TRAJECTORY, which is only visible
once routing is under way. So this module does not predict. It watches, and it
calls a plateau early enough to be worth something.

THE RULE, AND THE MARGIN BEHIND IT
----------------------------------
Plateau = over a window of 5 iterations, violations fell by less than 25%,
while still above a floor. Measured against the three real trajectories:

    worst 5-iteration improvement, healthy runs
      Block B @ 82.2% achieved      77.6%
      Block C @ 70.2% achieved      98.0%
    worst 5-iteration improvement, the failure
      Block C @ 80.9% achieved       7.2%   <- fires at iteration 9

A threshold of 25% sits an order of magnitude away from both healthy runs and
3x away from the failure. That is a wide gap, but it rests on THREE
trajectories, one of them a failure. Treat the number as provisional and
re-derive it as runs accumulate.

The floor exists because a converging run legitimately stalls near zero: Block
B sat at 1, 1, 1 before its final 0, which is a 0% improvement window and must
not be called a plateau. Below max(50, 1% of the initial count), a flat
trajectory is a run that has essentially finished.

A rise is caught by the same rule -- improvement goes negative, which is below
any positive threshold -- so the iteration-17 blowup needs no separate case.
