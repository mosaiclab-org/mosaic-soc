"""Workload power: a second STA pass over a finished run, with real activity.

Hardening is hours; this is minutes. It has to be separate because the
activity comes from simulating the ROUTED NETLIST, and that netlist is the
output of the run being analysed.

The comparison is the deliverable. The same netlist, parasitics and corner are
reported twice -- once with OpenSTA's default toggle model, which is what every
run in this project has silently been reporting, and once with activity read
from a gate-level VCD. Printing both is the point: a single number would just
replace one unlabelled figure with another.
