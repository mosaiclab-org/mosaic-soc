"""Emit a complete hardening config: invariant template plus derived floorplan.

Hardening Block A and Block B measured the split this module depends on. Of the keys in Block A's
signoff config, 33 were byte-identical in Block B's and carried over untouched
onto a design they were never tuned for. Five are design-specific:
``DESIGN_NAME``, ``CLOCK_PERIOD``, ``FP_SIZING``, ``DIE_AREA``, ``CORE_AREA``.

So the template is a real file with its comments intact -- those comments
record what each PDN and timing value cost to learn, and regenerating them
through a YAML dumper would throw that away -- and only the five derived keys
are appended. The output is concatenation, the same shape ``run_signoff.sh``
already uses to append the resolved file list, so the derived block is visibly
separate from the reviewed one.

``CLOCK_PERIOD`` is derived even though both hardened designs happen to use
100 ns: they agree because both chose 10 MHz, not because the value is a
property of the flow. Treating a coincidence as an invariant is how a template
acquires a value nobody can justify.
