"""What on-chip SRAM costs in GF180, so the refusal can be a design answer.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
`estimate_logic_area` refuses any design with `memory.sram_kb > 0`, and said
only "macro placement is not modelled". That is true and useless: someone
asking for "an SoC with two cores and 64 KB of RAM" -- the most ordinary
request there is -- learns that the tool has a gap, not that their design is
impossible.

It is impossible. Measured from the PDK's own LEFs:

    macro                             size (um)        area      per KB
    gf180mcu_fd_ip_sram__sram64x8    431.86 x 232.88   100,572   1.609 mm2
    gf180mcu_fd_ip_sram__sram128x8   431.86 x 268.88   116,119   0.929 mm2
    gf180mcu_fd_ip_sram__sram256x8   431.86 x 340.88   147,212   0.589 mm2
    gf180mcu_fd_ip_sram__sram512x8   431.86 x 484.88   209,400   0.419 mm2

The best density available is 0.419 mm2 per KB. For scale, the entire Block A
die -- a quarter of a shared project area, two harts, UART, SPI, timers, debug --
is 1.25 mm2, and Block C's four-hart die is 2.18 mm2. So:

    4 KB  =  1.68 mm2   already larger than Block A's whole die
   16 KB  =  6.70 mm2   three times Block C's whole die
   64 KB  = 26.80 mm2

`sram_kb: 0` across every design that has ever been hardened is not an
oversight. XIP from flash is the only architecture that fits, and this module
exists so the tool says that with a number instead of shrugging.

THE SECOND REASON, WHICH IS INDEPENDENT
---------------------------------------
Nothing in `hw/` or `configs/` instantiates a PDK SRAM macro. `sram_kb > 0`
produces x-heep's generic RAM, which synthesis maps to standard cells -- so
today the cost is not even the macro cost above, it is flip-flops, which for
64 KB is 524,288 bits of DFF plus decode. Comparable, and comparably
impossible.

Both routes are therefore closed, for different reasons, and closing either
one alone would not help. Adding macro support means adding a macro
instantiation path AND finding the silicon; this module quantifies the second
so nobody starts the first without knowing.
