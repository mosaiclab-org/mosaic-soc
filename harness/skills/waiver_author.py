"""Check a waiver against the run it cites, which nothing has ever done.

`parse_waivers` validates a waiver's SHAPE: keys present, justification long
enough, review_by a date, accepted_max a number. It never opens `evidence`.
Across the whole tree `Waiver.evidence` is only echoed back by `as_record()`,
so the field that names the measurement has always been an unread string.

That is what lets a structurally perfect waiver stop being true. The record on
this branch is the specimen: ceiling 1, evidence `runs/blocka_sdc`, every
structural check passing, and the design it describes measures 4 and 5 on the
runs that came after. Its cited run is a 1117.5 um macro -- a die size the
external padframe does not accept -- and its justification still says "the same single net
has been measured in every re-harden since", which three later runs falsify.

WHAT THIS CHECKS, and why each one exists rather than being invented:

  evidence resolves            the path is never opened today
  metric is present in it      a waiver can name a metric the run never measured
  ceiling == measured          a ceiling above the measurement waives headroom
                               nobody observed
  violators match              a COUNT is not an argument: ceiling 5 accepts
                               five clock roots at 16 and equally five
                               combinational nets at 40
  preconditions hold           justifications state conditions their argument
                               rests on, in prose, and nothing enforces them
  not expired                  review_by is a date nobody rereads
  still current                a waiver can be self-consistent and obsolete,
                               because the design moved to a newer run

WHAT IT DOES NOT DO. It does not write waivers. Authoring one is a decision
about silicon and belongs to a person; this reports whether the decision still
matches the measurement. Under `harness/skill_policy`, a skill that WROTE a
waiver would write evidence and require approval at any cost. This one reads.
