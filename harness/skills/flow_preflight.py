"""Cheap checks before an expensive flow, each one bought with a wasted run.

WHY THIS EXISTS. On 2026-09-09/10 a three-block re-harden cost roughly seven
wasted hours, and not one of those hours was spent on a hard problem. Every
failure was a precondition that a five-second check would have caught, and
every one of them reported itself as something else:

  disk filled at step 53 of 60      3 h 06 lost, after routing had already
                                    reached 0 DRT and 0 antenna violations
  config missing the template       2 runs, ~10 min, surfaced as a yosys
                                    syntax error in a vendored lowrisc file
  bundle hash moved by a previous
  run's own output                  3 x ~30 min regeneration, reported as
                                    "no MOSAIC manifest. Generate the RTL
                                    first" -- a missing INPUT
  run tag reused                    ~15 min misdiagnosing a step config from
                                    the previous attempt as the live one
  NDR pinned to synthesis names     a 4 h run that could not converge

THE SHAPE OF ALL FIVE. A long flow consumed a precondition nobody checked,
failed late, and blamed something downstream. The cost is not the failed run;
it is that the error message points away from the cause.

WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO. It does not check whether the design is good. Every
check here is about whether the run can *mean* anything -- disk, inputs,
identity, and rules that will not survive the run they are written for. A
clean preflight says the flow will produce a result, not that the result will
be one you like.

#: Free space a stage needs, in GB. Measured on this project's three blocks:
#: a hardening run's outputs are ~5 GB and an RTL bundle is ~20 GB. The
#: headroom is deliberate -- the run that filled the disk died with 0 bytes
#: left, three hours in.
NEEDS_GB: Dict[str, int] = {"harden": 12, "regen": 30}

#: Keys a hardening config must carry to be a WHOLE config rather than a
#: fragment. run_signoff.sh does `cat CONFIG FRAGMENT`, so the config file is
#: the entire thing -- it does not merge the template. A file holding only
#: design keys parses, runs, and silently takes LibreLane's defaults:
#: USE_SLANG went False and yosys's Verilog-2005 frontend then rejected an
#: unpacked-array parameter that slang accepts.
TEMPLATE_MARKERS = ("meta", "USE_SLANG", "PNR_CORNERS", "CLOCK_PORT")

#: A net name of this shape is emitted by synthesis and does not denote the
#: same net across a re-synthesis. Two separate incidents: `_28773_` looked
#: like a smoking gun in the GLS investigation, and a DRT_ASSIGN_NDR pinned
#: to `_06890_` &c silently stopped applying after a re-harden.
