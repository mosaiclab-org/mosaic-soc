"""What a second PDK must supply, and what it would silently inherit.

The stated goal is any SoC on any PDK. GF180 is the first target, not the only
one. But `pdk` is threaded through this codebase as a LABEL -- recorded in
configs, metrics, manifests and software headers -- and almost nothing branches
on it. GF180 values are baked in as though one PDK exists.

So a second PDK does not fail at a "this PDK is unsupported" check. It produces
numbers. The measured demonstration, before this module existed: taking a
shipped config, changing one key to `pdk: sky130`, and asking for a floorplan
returned the identical GF180 die with `basis="measured"`. A wrong number is
recoverable. A wrong number wearing the word "measured" is not, because that
label is the only reason anyone would trust it.

THE UNIT IS NOT THE PDK. `SITE_HEIGHT_UM = 3.92` is not a GF180 constant; it
is the 7-track library's. `gf180mcu_fd_sc_mcu9t5v0`, in the same PDK tree, is
5.04. Two cell libraries, one PDK, different geometry, and the die arithmetic
depends on it. So a requirement is keyed by TECHNOLOGY -- pdk plus cell
library -- and a check that only compares PDK names is reported as partial
rather than passed.

WHAT THIS SKILL DOES. It enumerates the requirements, says which the repository
satisfies for a given technology, and names what would be silently inherited
from GF180 if the missing ones are ignored. It ports nothing: the work of
porting is hardening a design and measuring it, which no tool can shortcut.
