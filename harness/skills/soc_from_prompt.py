"""soc-from-prompt skill — deterministic natural-language → SoC pipeline.

The no-LLM fallback path of the mosaic prompt→SoC story (and the CI-able
demo): a small, ordered regex grammar extracts core groups, memory, bus,
scheduler and peripherals from a prompt; every match is recorded with
provenance (`matched`) and every leftover content token is surfaced
(`unrecognized`) — nothing is silently guessed. Repairs (e.g. auto-adding a
TITAN) are applied deterministically and REPORTED in the summary.

An LLM agent uses the same slots through the .claude/skills/soc-from-prompt
card, but calls `plan` first to see how the deterministic parse reads the
request, then overrides via config-author when its own reading differs.

Pipeline (run --run): config-author generate → topo-viz check (GATE) →
flow-runner mosaic-gen-config (GATE) → flow-runner tb-soc-generic (GATE:
every configured hart executes before EXIT SUCCESS) → doc-gen config summary.
