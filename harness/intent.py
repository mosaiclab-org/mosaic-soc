"""A typed view over a validated SoC config, so consumers stop reading YAML.

WHAT THIS IS, AND WHAT IT IS NOT
--------------------------------
This is one requirement of the planned intermediate representation --
"templates no longer need direct access to raw YAML" -- and nothing else. It is
NOT `DesignIntentIR`, and it is certainly not `ResolvedSoCIR`: those are
twenty-odd types covering pads, packages, supplies, power domains, coherence
and software, and by that refactor's own exit condition ("existing generated
artifacts remain semantically equivalent") the whole refactor ends with zero
capability delta.

So this builds the one piece that is load-bearing NOW. The IR can be deferred
without cost *provided the physical lowering reads through a small explicit
interface rather than raw YAML*, and yet the floorplan derivation first shipped
as `derive_floorplan(soc.get("cores", []))`. The constraint that was supposed
to preserve the option was never imposed. This imposes it.

WHY A VIEW AND NOT A PARSER
---------------------------
`DesignIntent` does not re-validate. It is constructed from a mapping that
`validate_soc_config` has already accepted, and `from_mapping` runs that
validator rather than inventing a second, drifting notion of what a legal
config is. One validator, one schema, one place to change.

The consequence worth stating: a field absent from the YAML gets the same
default here that the consumers were applying inline, and those defaults are
recorded on the dataclass instead of being repeated at every call site. That
is the actual bug class this closes -- `soc.get("memory", {})` in one module
and `soc.get("memory") or {}` in another disagree when `memory:` is present
but null.
